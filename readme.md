### **Welcome to _HANG MAN_**

## The Requirements

Create the game hangman. I extended the game to use a timer for words as well as
a parent or someone adding specific words that a child could guess

##  My Approach

I used objects to split the functionality. The idea I had was to splt the game into 2 parts, part 1 was to enter words into the game say by a parent and part 2 was for the child to play hangman and try guess those words.

I has difficulty choosing colours etc for the CSS and hence chose white and black.

I can look into improving the look pretty part.
